Badge Layout maker
===================
A quick little hack to layout badge images onto an A4 page.

Uses fPDF to do the magic PDF creation http://www.fpdf.org/

** VERY EXPERIMENTAL ** 
This is my first quick hack to see if this will make the layout any quicker than Photoshop for 100s of badges.

To use:
0. Set your configs as you see fit in /-/config.php
1. Load all of the images into the folder defined in config.php - IMAGEFOLDER
2. Load up PDFcreator.php in your favourite web browser
3. Make a cup of tea
4. Look for your newly created in the path defined in config.php e.g. OUTPUTFOLDER/OUTPUTNAME
